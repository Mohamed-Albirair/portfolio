***Implementation science researcher, R programmer of quantitative analysis and data visualization, mathematical modeler, and research methodologist***

Hi, I'm Mohamed Albirair, a physician by training, an independent public health scientist and research methodologist.
I worked on evaluating the Universal Health Coverage in Sudan with the [Public Health Institute](http://www.phi.edu.sd/#:~:text=The%20Public%20Health%20Institute%20will,beyond%20in%20the%20region%20.), Sudanese Ministry of Health.
I also joined the Blue Nile National Institute for Communicable Diseases (BNNICD) as a monitoring and evaluation officer contributing to the [Country-Focused Evaluations](https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/related/?&page=1&c=&s=&t=Country-focused%20evaluations) with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. 

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Implementation Science (June 2025) at the Department of Global Health, University of Washington.
In my PhD dissertation research, I utilized microsimulation models ([CISNET](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/) models) in collaboration with mentors at the [Etzioni Lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/etzioni/en.html), Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center to evaluate cancer-control strategies.
More specifically, I evaluated the impact of race-specific screening strategies on mitigating racial disparities in prostate cancer in the US.
I also assessed cost-effectiveness of blood-based colorectal cancer screening modalities to the US population.
Additionally, I have built a proof-of-concept model to project the health and economic impacts of comprehensive cancer-control strategies, including analyses of financial risk protection and progress toward Universal Health Coverage.
I am presently carrying this work forward and building a decision-support tool to enhance evidence utility.

My primary research interest is applying mathematical and simulation modeling as an implementation strategy.
I develop and use models to conduct 'a priori' evaluations of health interventions and policies.
This approach allows decision-makers to answer critical 'what-if' and 'how-to' questions (e.g., such as forecasting health impacts, optimizing resource allocation, and assessing equity implications) *before* resources are consumed or committed.
My mission is to promote the culture of data utilization and enhance decision making by translating complex data into actionable insights for cancer control and for health systems in general.

I am an R enthusiast and programmer of quantitative analyses and data visualization. 
I am actively seeking collaborations and roles where I can apply my modeling and implementation science skills to tackle complex challenges in global health, disease control, and health policy.
