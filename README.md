## Core Competencies
### Research Design and Implementation
- Experienced in observational, randomized (c/RCTs), non-randomized (DiD, ITS, RDD) studies design and data analysis.

### Quantitative Analysis and Programming
- Over 10 years of experience in programming quantitative data analysis, primarily using R (intermediate proficiency in STATA).
- Skilled in data processing, wrangling (tidyverse), and knitting publication-quality RMarkdown and Quarto manuscripts.
- Proficient in statistical methods (hypothesis testing, non-/linear regression models, time series, and output interpretation).
- Experienced in functional programming (parallelization and regular expressions) with readable, portable, and reliable code.
- Advanced skills in mathematical modeling (Markov models, Monte Carlo simulation), and simulating scenarios for analysis.
- Considerable experience with health-services survey data (MEPS) and population-based cancer registry data (SEER).
