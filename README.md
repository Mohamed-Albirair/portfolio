[Mohamed Albirair, PhD](/assets/img/portfolio/Mohamed-Albirair_050522_001-2.png)

Hi, I'm Mohamed Albirair, a physician by training, an independent public health scientist and research methodologist.
I worked on evaluating the Universal Health Coverage in Sudan with the [Public Health Institute](http://www.phi.edu.sd/#:~:text=The%20Public%20Health%20Institute%20will,beyond%20in%20the%20region%20.), Sudanese Ministry of Health, served as a monitoring and evaluation officer contributing to the Prospective Country Evaluation ([link](https://archive.theglobalfund.org/media/11632/archive_terg-pce-evaluation_report_en.pdf)) with the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria. 

I recently completed my Ph.D. in Implementation Science (June 2025) at the Department of Global Health, University of Washington.

My primary research interest is applying mathematical and simulation modeling as an implementation strategy.
I develop and use models to conduct 'a priori' evaluations of health interventions and policies.
This approach allows decision-makers to answer critical "what-if" and "how-to" questions—such as forecasting health impacts, optimizing resource allocation, and assessing equity implications—*before* committing substantial resources.
My goal is to make the path to scaling evidence-based practices more efficient, equitable, and informed.

My PhD dissertation research utilized microsimulation models (e.g., CISNET models) in collaboration with mentors at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center to evaluate strategies for reducing disparities in prostate cancer outcomes and to assess the cost-effectiveness of blood-based colorectal cancer screening modalities.
I have also built a proof-of-concept model to project the health and economic impacts of comprehensive cancer-control strategies, including analyses of financial risk protection and progress toward Universal Health Coverage.
I am presently carrying this work forward and building a decision-support tool to enhance evidence utility.
I am an R enthusiast and programmer of quantitative analyses and data visualization whose mission is to enhance decision making promote the culture of data utilization by translating complex data into actionable insights for cancer control and for health systems in general.

I am actively seeking collaborations and roles where I can apply my modeling and implementation science skills to tackle complex challenges in global health, disease control, and health policy.
