## Work Experience

### Data Scientist (Contractor); Institude of Disease Modeling
- _(Oct 2025 - Jan 2026)_
- Analyzed contraceptive supply and demand dynamics and applied unsupervised clustering techniques to create facility archetypes to operationalize findings within [FPsim](https://www.idmod.org/tool/fpsim/) simulation model and strengthen evidence base for intervention design.

### Research Analyst; Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center
- _(Mar 2022 - Jun 2025)_
- Identified drivers and strategies to mitigate disparities in fatal prostate cancer incidnece in the US.
- Evaluated cost-effectiveness implications of introducing of blood tests for CRC screening in the US.

### Research Analyst; Department of Global Health
- _(Sep 2021 - Jun 2025)_
- Programmed a hybrid decision-analytic (Markov) and demographic (Cohort-Component) model in R to project the long-term costs and health impacts of comprehensive cancer control strategies in varying income settings, as well as the impact of varying financing strategies on financial risk protection.

### Research Analyst; International Clinical Research Center, University of Washington
- _(Sep 2021 - Mar 2022)_
- Contributed to the analysis of the [PEER trial](https://globalhealth.unc.edu/malawi/peer-cervical-cancer-health-facilities-meet-for-review/) in Malawi: to compare cost-effectiveness of facility- and community-based HPV screen-and-treat strategies on preventing cervical cancer.
- Built a stochastic, microsimulation model in R to estimate monthly HPV strain-specific transition probabilities across health states.
- Conducted a time-and-motion study (TMS) data analysis using field observation data to estimate facility-level service costs.

### Research Study Coordinator and Data Analyst; University of Washington Medical Center and Harborview Medical Center
- _(Oct 2015 - Aug 2016)_
- Led statistical analysis of [UW-IPASS](https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14209509), a quality-improvement cluster-randomized trial in Intensive Care Units using stepped-wedge design.
