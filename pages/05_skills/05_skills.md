# Core Competencies

## Research Design and Implementation
Experienced in designing and analyzing studies across the research spectrum, from establishing causality to evaluating impact in real-world settings.
- **Observational Studies:** Proficient in designing and analyzing retrospective and prospective cohort studies, cross-sectional analyses, and case-control studies.
- **Causal Inference from non-randomized studies:** Experienced with study designs to estimate causal effects, including Difference-in-Differences (DiD), Interrupted Time Series (ITS), and Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDD), after teaching a dedicated class on Quasai-Experimental Designs (QEDs) for three consequtive PhD cohorts.
- **Trial Methodology:** Experienced in both cluster-randomized controlled trials cRCTs) [[link to article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2666835)] and individual-level randomized controlled trials (RCTs).
- **Systematic Reviews:** Took an advanced-methods class and contributed to a published systematic review [[link to article](https://doi.org/10.1002/jia2.25635)].


## Quantitative Analysis and Programming
Over a decade of experience as a research-oriented programmer in R, focused on building robust, and reproducible analytic pipelines.
- **R expertise:** 12+ years using R for statistical computing and data science, with deep expertise in `tidyverse` for efficient data wrangling, transformation, and visualization.
- **Advanced statistical methods:** Proficient in a wide range of statistical methods—from regression and survival analysis to complex survey techniques—with a focus on accurate output interpretation and contextualization for diverse audiences.
- **Mathematical modeling:** Advanced skills in developing and applying mathematical and microsimulation models (e.g., [CISNET](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/) models) for disease progression, cost-effectiveness analysis, and policy forecasting.
- **Programming best practices:** Engineer modular, readable, and reliable functions to enhance reproducibility and collaboration. Check out this [GitHub repo](https://mohamed-albirair.github.io/my-R-functions/) that hosts a curated collection of reusable code utilities.
- **Functional programming:** Skilled in using `purrr` package, regular expressions and other functional programming paradigms to write concise, efficient, and error-resistant code for iterative tasks.
- **Machine learning algorithms:** Foundational understanding of and practical experience applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning algorithms for prediction and classification tasks.
- **Reproducible research:** Expert in authoring dynamic, publication-quality documents and reports using RMarkdown and Quarto, ensuring full transparency from data to findings.


## Data Visualization
Committed to translating complex data into clear, compelling, and actionable visual stories for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.
- **Static & Dynamic Visualization:** Experienced in building sophisticated static graphics with `ggplot2` and creating interactive data dashboards and tools with `R Shiny` to facilitate exploration and decision-making.
- **Strategic Communication:** Demonstrated ability to tailor visualizations for specific purposes and audiences, from detailed research figures to high-impact presentation slides.
- Demonstrated results-oriented data visualization skills—examples: [Likert scale](https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014001), [bivariate choropleth map](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32292-X/fulltext), [PowerPoint](https://gatesopenresearch.org/slides/7-11)
