# Work Experience

## Institude of Disease Modeling, Gates Foundation, Seattle, WA
### Data Scientist (Contractor) | Oct 2025--Jan 2026
- Analyzed facility survey data and generated evidence about contraceptive supply and demand dynamics
- Applied unsupervised clustering techniques to create facility archetypes to operationalize findings within [FPsim](https://www.idmod.org/tool/fpsim/) simulation model and strengthen evidence base for intervention design.

## Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, Seattle, WA
### Research Analyst | Mar 2022--Jun 2025
- Identified drivers of racial disparities in fatal prostate cancer incidence in the US using the [Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database](https://seer.cancer.gov/data-software/) (links to: [article](https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pkaf103) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Mohamed-Albirair/age_specific_fpca_racial_disparities/tree/main)).
- Collaborated to define Risk-Adaptive PCa screening strategies and explore implementation barriers and facilitators ([link to article](https://academic.oup.com/jnci/article/116/1/34/7274818)).
- Projected impact of race-specific prostate cancer-screening strategies using the Fred Hutch's prostate cancer miscrosimulation model ([PSAPC](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/resources/model-registry/prostate-models/PSAPC.html#/)) *(manuscript in process)*.
- Evaluated cost-effectiveness implications of introducing of blood tests for CRC screening in the US using two independent CISNET microsimulation models ([CRC-SPIN](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/resources/model-registry/colorectal-models/CRC-SPIN.html#/) and [MISCAN-Colon](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/resources/model-registry/colorectal-models/MISCAN-colon.html#/)) *(manuscript in process)*.


## Department of Global Health, University of Washington, Seattle, WA
### Research Analyst | Sep 2021--Jun 2025
- Worked on the World Bank [Healthy Longevity Initiative](https://www.worldbank.org/en/topic/health/publication/unlocking-power-healthy-longevity) and designed epidemiological models for various NCDs.
- Collaborated with country partners and working groups from the [Lancet Commission for Cancer and Health Systems](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)01895-X/fulltext).
- Programmed a hybrid decision-analytic (Markov) and demographic (Cohort-Component) model in R using parameters values from [GBD Results](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results) to project long-term costs and health impacts of comprehensive cancer control strategies in varying income settings; as well as impact of varying financing strategies on financial risk protection *(manuscript in process)*.

## International Clinical Research Center, University of Washington, Seattle, WA
### Research Analyst | Sep 2021--Mar 2022
- Contributed to the analysis of the [PEER trial](https://globalhealth.unc.edu/malawi/peer-cervical-cancer-health-facilities-meet-for-review/) in Malawi: to compare cost-effectiveness of facility- and community-based HPV screen-and-treat strategies on preventing cervical cancer.
- Built a stochastic, microsimulation model in R to estimate monthly HPV strain-specific transition probabilities across health states.
- Conducted a time-and-motion study (TMS) data analysis using field observation data to estimate facility-level service costs.

## Blue Nile National Institute for Communicable Diseases (BNNICD), Wad Madani, Gezira, Sudan
### Project Monitoring and Evaluation Officer/Study Lead | Jun 2017-–Sep 2019
- Worked on the Prospective Country Evaluation (PCE), overseen by [Technical Evaluation Reference Group (TERG)](https://archive.theglobalfund.org/technical-evaluation-reference-group/), evaluating the impact of the Global Fund to fight AIDS, TB, and Malaria (GFATM) investments and the Business Model [[link to reports](https://www.theglobalfund.org/en/related/?&page=1&c=&s=&t=Country-focused%20evaluations)].
- Developed an evaluation framework for Global Fund Business Model and Global Fund strategic themes in Sudan, and grant implementation using impact causal pathways that incorporated quantitative and qualitative methods.
- Led the Impact Evaluation (IE) workstream in consultation with **University of California – San Francisco (UCSF)**.
- Coordinated efforts with M&E officers at both the **Disease-Control Directorate (CNCDCD)** and **Health Information System (HIS)** directorates within the Sudanese Federal Ministry of Health (FMoH) to promote evidence-based decision-making.
- Conducted data mapping to understand the HIS, track data flows and flag areas for improvement in reporting data quality.

## University of Washington Medical Center and Harborview Medical Center, Seattle, WA
### Research Study Coordinator and Data Analyst | Oct 2015--Aug 2016
- Led statistical analysis of [UW-IPASS](https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14209509), a quality-improvement cluster-randomized trial in Intensive Care Units using stepped-wedge design [[link to article](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamasurgery/fullarticle/2666835)].
- Managed datasets of participants' survey responses and patient mortality data using **MS Excel**, **REDCap** and **Qualtrics**.
