## Work Experience

### Institude of Disease Modeling, Gates Foundation
#### Data Scientist (Contractor) | Oct 2025--Jan 2026
- Analyzed facility survey data and generated evidence about contraceptive supply and demand dynamics
- Applied unsupervised clustering techniques to create facility archetypes to operationalize findings within [FPsim](https://www.idmod.org/tool/fpsim/) simulation model and strengthen evidence base for intervention design.

### Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center
#### Research Analyst | Mar 2022--Jun 2025
- Identified drivers of racial disparities in fatal prostate cancer incidence in the US (links to: [article](https://doi.org/10.1093/jncics/pkaf103) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/Mohamed-Albirair/age_specific_fpca_racial_disparities/tree/main)).
- Projected impact of race-specific prostate cancer-screening strategies using the Fred Hutch's prostate cancer miscrosimulation model ([PSAPC](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/resources/model-registry/prostate-models/PSAPC.html#/)) *(manuscript in process)*.
- Evaluated cost-effectiveness implications of introducing of blood tests for CRC screening in the US using two independent CISNET microsimulation models ([CRC-SPIN](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/resources/model-registry/colorectal-models/CRC-SPIN.html#/) and [MISCAN-Colon](https://cisnet.cancer.gov/resources/model-registry/colorectal-models/MISCAN-colon.html#/)) *(manuscript in process)*.

### Department of Global Health, University of Washington
#### Research Analyst | Sep 2021--Jun 2025
- Programmed a hybrid decision-analytic (Markov) and demographic (Cohort-Component) model in R using parameters values from [GBD Results](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/gbd-results) to project:
   - Long-term costs and health impacts of comprehensive cancer control strategies in varying income settings; and
   - Impact of varying financing strategies on financial risk protection.

### International Clinical Research Center, University of Washington
#### Research Analyst | Sep 2021--Mar 2022
- Contributed to the analysis of the [PEER trial](https://globalhealth.unc.edu/malawi/peer-cervical-cancer-health-facilities-meet-for-review/) in Malawi: to compare cost-effectiveness of facility- and community-based HPV screen-and-treat strategies on preventing cervical cancer.
- Built a stochastic, microsimulation model in R to estimate monthly HPV strain-specific transition probabilities across health states.
- Conducted a time-and-motion study (TMS) data analysis using field observation data to estimate facility-level service costs.

### University of Washington Medical Center and Harborview Medical Center
#### Research Study Coordinator and Data Analyst | Oct 2015--Aug 2016
- Led statistical analysis of [UW-IPASS](https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN14209509), a quality-improvement cluster-randomized trial in Intensive Care Units using stepped-wedge design.

## Core Competencies

### Research Design and Implementation
- Experienced in observational, randomized (c/RCTs), non-randomized (DiD, ITS, RDD) studies design and data analysis.

### Quantitative Analysis and Programming
- 12 years of experience in quantitative analysis with R
- Engineer modular, readable, portable, and reliable functions ([example](https://mohamed-albirair.github.io/my-R-functions/))
- Skilled in data processing, wrangling using `tidyverse`
- Knit publication-quality RMarkdown and Quarto manuscripts
- Proficient in statistical methods and output interpretation
- Experienced in functional programming and regular expressions
- Advanced skills in mathematical modeling and simulation
- Foundational understanding of machine learning algorithms

### Data Visualization
- Experienced in data graphical programming (`ggplot2`, `R Shiny`)
- Demonstrated results-oriented data visualization skills—examples: [Likert scale](https://gh.bmj.com/content/9/4/e014001), [bivariate choropleth map](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712(20)32292-X/fulltext), [PowerPoint](https://gatesopenresearch.org/slides/7-11)
